### Welcome to my page! 

I'm Jisenku, currently 17 and doing many... many different things.

- I go by he/they pronouns and identify as an amalgamation of every stupid thing I've ever done
- I'm on GitHub to utilize and to support different communities & projects that I'm interested in, and to maybe learn to code
- I literally only know markdown & cmd scripting... that's it, and I barely know cmd.
- The best ways to reach me are:
  - Discord: Jisenku#9277 (Easiest to contact)
  - Email: jisenku@gmail.com (Will redirect to my personal email)
 
- For more information about me, too bad :)
